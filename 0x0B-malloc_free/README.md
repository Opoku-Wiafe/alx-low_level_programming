introduction to malloc .
malloc is a function in C programming language that stands for “memory allocation”. It is used to dynamically allocate memory at runtime.

When you declare a variable in C, the compiler allocates memory for that variable during compilation. However, sometimes you may not know how much memory you need until your program is running. That’s where malloc comes in.

You can use malloc to allocate memory for variables at runtime. The function takes one argument, which is the number of bytes of memory to allocate. For example, if you want to allocate 10 bytes of memory, you would call malloc(10).

Here’s an example of how to use malloc:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr;
    ptr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory not allocated.\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    else {
        printf("Memory successfully allocated using malloc.\n");
        free(ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}
In this example, we declare a pointer variable called ptr. We then use malloc to allocate memory for 5 integers (which is 5 times the size of an integer). We check if the memory was successfully allocated by checking if the pointer is NULL. If it’s not NULL, we print a message saying that the memory was successfully allocated and then free the memory using the free function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
